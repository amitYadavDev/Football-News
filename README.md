# Observer Pattern
- The Observer pattern sets up a connection between a subject and multiple observers, where the observers are interested in the subject's state.
- Imagine a news publisher and a group of subscribers. Subscribers can sign up to receive updates from the publisher. Whenever new content is released, subscribers are notified through the channel they subscribed to.
